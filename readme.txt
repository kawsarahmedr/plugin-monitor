   Track WordPress.org plugin update information using the official `plugins_api()` function. View plugin stats in a simple dashboard card layout with scheduled updates via cron.

   == Description ==

   **Plugin Monitor** lets you easily track and display update details for any public WordPress.org plugin by using their slugs. Designed for developers, agencies, and site admins who need a central view of important plugin info.

   This plugin pulls plugin information from the WordPress.org repository using the official `plugins_api()` function, stores the data using WordPress transients, and refreshes it hourly using a cron job.

   No complicated setup. No multiple admin pages. Just paste your plugin slugs and you're good to go.

   == Frequently Asked Questions ==

   = Where do I find the plugin slug? =
   You can get the slug from the plugin's WordPress.org URL. For example, for https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/, the slug is `woocommerce`.

   = Can I track premium or non-directory plugins? =
   No. Plugin Monitor only tracks plugins listed on the official [WordPress.org repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/).

   = How often does the data update? =
   Once per hour via WordPress cron. You can also manually refresh data by clicking the "Save & Refresh Data" button.

   = Can I display this data on the frontend? =
   Not yet â€” this plugin is currently focused on admin-only usage.
